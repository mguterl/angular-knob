# Angular Knob

**This is not a complete solution, if you are looking for something more
complete check [https://github.com/yunlzheng/angular-knob]()**

Evil Trout (Robin Ward) put together a really [great
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_l_DL8ysQQ&feature=youtu.be) on showing
how to build a reusable Ember Component that wraps a jQuery plugin. I've been
working with Angular lately and I wanted to go through the process of building
the same component with Angular.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mguterl/angular-knob.git
cd angular-knob
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000]() and you can see the directive in
action.
